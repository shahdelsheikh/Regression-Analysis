Regression Analysis (Life Expectancy Analysis for Egypt 2020) using R.
Introduction
The Human Development Index (HDI) is a widely recognized measure that assesses the overall development and well-being of countries. It combines various indicators, for example: life expectancy, education, and income. In the context of human development, multiple linear regression analysis can be applied to investigate the factors that influence the indicators such as life expectancy, education, or income.
Objective
The objective of this project was to fit a multiple linear regression model for HDI in the year 2021, using the life expectancy at birth as the response variable and having 7 explanatory variables, namely (Human Development Index Value, Human Development Index Rank 2021, Expected Years of Schooling, Mean Years of Schooling, Gross National Income per Capita (GNI), Gross National Income Per capita Rank minus HDI rank, and Human Development Index Rank 2020) to determine the effect of the explanatory variables on the response one.
Methodology 
Descriptive statistics were used at the start to get an overview on the data, generating scatter plots to visualize the relation between each one of the explanatory variables and the response variable. Also, Correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the strength and direction of these relationships.Moving forward, we started checking model assumptions, fitted the suitable model after using different methods (backward elimination, forward selection, and stepwise) to determine the best model, and assessed the goodness of fit for the constructed model.
